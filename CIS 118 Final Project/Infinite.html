    <p>Infinite is the debut album for Eminem. Physical copies were released only on cassette and vinyl, and Eminem sold them from the trunk of his car in Detroit. The songs on Infinite were labeled "radio-friendly" in hopes of getting played on Detroit radio stations, but only around a thousand copies were made. With this ontop of only selling 70 copies, the album was quickly written off as a commercial failure.</p>
