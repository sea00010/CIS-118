    <p>Production for the album took place during 2016 to 2017 at various recording studios. In addition to Eminem himself, music production was handled by various record producers, including Rick Rubin, Fredwreck, Skylar Grey, Alex da Kid, and executive producer Dr. Dre. Revival features guest appearances from artists Beyonc√©, Phresher, Ed Sheeran, Alicia Keys, X Ambassadors, Skylar Grey, Kehlani, and Pink. Eminem first revealed that he was working on an album following the release of "Campaign Speech" in October 2016. A year later, he performed a viral freestyle at the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards, criticizing President Donald Trump. The album has many lines critiquing Trump's presidential campaign and election. Reception to Revival was mixed, with critics divided over its rock-influenced production on several songs and the heavy use of pop artists for guest appearances. The album debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Finland, the UK, and the US. In addition, it was the UK Christmas number one album of 2017 and has been certified platinum in the UK.<p>
