    <h4>The album was released with no prior announcement. It features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon from the band Bon Iver. Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and Dr. Dre served as executive producers, while production was handled by Eminem himself alongside a variety of producers such as Boi-1da, Tay Keith, Ronny J, Mike Will Made It, frequent collaborator Luis Resto, and others. Following the polarizing reception of his previous album, music journalists debated over whether the rapper's relevance and ability were waning. Kamikaze represents a continuation of this response, containing various insults against critics and rappers alike. The artwork is an homage to Beastie Boys' debut album, Licensed to Ill (1986). The album received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised it as an improvement over the rapper's previous album and a welcome return to his more aggressive style, while others criticized its lack of adaption to the current sound of hip hop, and as a result, found it outdated. The album also generated some controversy for its diss tracks against various artists.</h4>
