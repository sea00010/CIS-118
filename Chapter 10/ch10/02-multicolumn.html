			<h2>Doing the Doodle</h2>
			<p>Did you know that you remember about 10% of what you read, but 90% of what you see? Brain Doodles&rsquo; lessons will show you how using doodles for note taking can help to improve your memory, understanding, and help you solve problems, by combining the senses of sight, hearing, and touch!</p>
			<p><b>Targeting the Audience:</b> While Brain Doodles is targeted for high school students, anyone can use and benefit from the tutorials. Give it a try and see what doodling can do for you.</p>
			<p><b>Drawing Tools:</b> You can choose to draw with whatever you have or feel most comfortable with, but a pencil (with an eraser) is a great choice to start out with.</p>
			<p>Grab a sheet from your printer, a post-it, or get a sketchbook (carry around a Moleskin sketchbook in your pocket)!</p>
