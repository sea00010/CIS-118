 <p id="greeting"><span class="misspelledText">Hello, Muddah! Hello, Faddah!</span> Hello, Mother! Hello, Father!</p>

<p class="bodyText">Here I am at Camp Granada. Camp is very entertaining and they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining.</p>

 <p class="bodyText">I went hiking with Joe Spivy. He developed poison ivy. You remember Leonard Skinner.
 He got towmane Ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner.</p>

<p class="bodyText">All the counselors hate the waiters, and the lake has alligators, and the head coach wants no sissies, so he reads to us from something called ulissies Ulysses.</p>

<p class="bodyText">Now I don't want this should scare ya you, but my bunkmate has malaria. You remember Jeffrey Hardy. They're about to organize a searching party.</p>

<p class="bodyText">Take me home, oh Mother, Father! Take me home! I hate Granada! Don't leave me out in the forest where I might get eaten by a bear.</p>

<p class="bodyText">Take me home! I promise I will not make noise, or mess the house with other boys.
 Oh, please don't make me stay! I've been here one whole day!</p>

<p class="bodyText">Dearest Father, darling Mother, how's my preshus precious little bruddah brother? Let me come home if you miss me. I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me.</p>

 <p class="bodyText">Wait a minute! It's stopped hailing. Guys are swimming. Guys are sailing. Playing baseball! Gee, that's bettah better.</p>

 <p class="bodyText">Mother, Father, kindly disregard this letter!</p>
